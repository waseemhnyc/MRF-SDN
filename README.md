# MRF-SDN
### Multi-Robot Framework Software Development Notes

This project is dedicated to consolidating software packages, tools and examples used in Mobile Robotics (Ground and Aerial). With these resources in place, we hope that it encourages the development of applications that require multiple and different type of robots. The idea is to use robot's individual and specific strengths, together. This will open the door to applications that the robots can achieve while working as one.

In order to use most of the tools, found in this Software Development Notes (SDN), your robot or your development computer (Desktop/Laptop, Raspberry Pi, Odroid, Nvidia TK1) is required to have a Linux operating system with a ROS installation. We recommend to first refer to the Linux - Installation directory for tutorials on installing a Linux distribution depending on your hardware device. Then move to the ROS-Installation directory to install ROS on your device. 

From that point forward you can begin to test and use the different software packages. Refer to the appropriate directory that best fit your requirements or goal.
